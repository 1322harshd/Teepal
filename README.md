## Setup
 
### Requirements
 
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- Werkzeug
- SQLite3
 
### Installation
 
1. Clone the repository or copy the project files.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install flask werkzeug
   ```
3. Initialize the SQLite database:
   - Run the provided SQL scripts to create tables (`Users`, `Products`, `CartItems`, `SavedItems`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`, `CustomRequests`).
   - Add an admin user (see below).
 
4. Place product images in `static/products/` and user images in `static/users/`.
 
### Admin Credentials
 
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Image: `image.png` (place in `static/users/`)
 
To add the admin user, run this SQL in your database:
```sql
INSERT INTO Users (Name, DisplayName, Email, Password, Image, SecurityQuestion, SecurityAnswer)
VALUES (
    'admin',
    'Administrator',
    'admin@example.com',
    '<hashed_password_for_admin123>',
    'image.png',
    'pet',
    'admin'
);
```
Replace `<hashed_password_for_admin123>` with the hash generated by your Flask app.
 
### Running the App
 
```bash
python app.py
```
Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.
 
## Usage
 
- **Users:** Register, log in, browse products, customize and save designs, add to cart, and place orders.
- **Admin:** Log in with admin credentials to access the admin dashboard for managing products, users, and customization requests.
 
## Customization
 
- The product customization page uses Fabric.js for drag-and-drop, text, and image overlays.
- Saved designs are stored as images and can be revisited and edited.
 
## Database Schema
 
- `Users`: User accounts (including admin)
- `Products`: Product catalogue
- `CartItems`: Shopping cart items
- `SavedItems`: Saved designs and products
- `Orders`, `OrderDetails`: Order history
- `CustomRequests`: Customization requests for admin approval
 
## Notes
 
- Make sure to create all required tables before running the app.
- Place all static files (images, CSS, JS) in the appropriate `static/` subfolders.
- For production, set a secure `app.secret_key` and use a production-ready server.
